# Program to Calculate Area and Perimeter of a Circle


## Write a program that calculates the area and perimeter of the circle whose radius we get from the user.



* Area Formula: π * r * r;



* Environment Formula: 2 * π * r;



W## rite a program to find the area of a segment of a circle with radius r and measure 𝛼 of the central angle.



* Take the number 𝜋 = 3.14.



* Formula : (𝜋 * (r*r) * 𝛼) / 360
