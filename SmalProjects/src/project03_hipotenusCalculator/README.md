# Program to Find Hypotenuse in Right Triangle


## Write a program in Java that takes the length of the perpendicular sides from the user and calculates the hypotenuse.


## Write a program that calculates the area of the triangle whose three side lengths you get from the user.



Formula


three𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑖𝑛 ç𝑒𝑣𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑖 = 2𝑢



𝑢 = (a+b+c) / 2



Area * Area = 𝑢 * (𝑢 − 𝑎)* (𝑢 − 𝑏) * (𝑢 − 𝑐)
